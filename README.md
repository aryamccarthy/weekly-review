# weekly-review
Quick, one-page, GTD-style weekly review and planning

## Background

Based on the [Productivity Planner](https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-productivity-planner#modal), but I'm broke so this is something I can print out to reflect. It's sort of a dashboard for the coming week, so I keep growing [exponentially, not logarithmically](http://jamesclear.com/growth-curves).

## Personalization

To make it your own, change the line with
```latex
\author{Arya McCarthy}
```
to your own name.
